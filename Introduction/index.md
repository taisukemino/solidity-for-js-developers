# Introduction

My hunch is that Solidity will be the blockchain equivalent of JavaScript as one of the most popular and simultaneously unpopular language.

There are other languages to write smart contracts such as Serpent, Vyper and LLL. You might want to have a look at them before you jump into Solidity.

I write this document for JavaScript developers. You donâ€™t have to know any other languages. If you know how to write TypeScript, you will find Solidity easy to learn.

Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level language. Solidity code is complied to Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM) so that computers can understand. EVM is more of an interpreter.

Solidity syntax is somewhat similar to that of JavaScript but there are some differences:

- it is statically typed
- it has Contracts which is like Classes
- it has predefined/custom modifier functions
- it has other data types like addresses and user-defined types
- it supports inheritance and libraries
